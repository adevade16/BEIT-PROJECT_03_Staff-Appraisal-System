#### Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version.

3. Enter the repository: `cd BEIT-PROJECT_04_Staff-Appraisal-System/`
4. Install and run the app with: `npm install && npm start` \
   For **Server Only** use: `npm install && node serveronly` .

**Important:** Make sure to add .env file in the root of the application. Make sure that you whitelist the interface/ip (`ipWhitelist`) in the server config where you have created the mongodb collection, otherwise it will not be allowed to connect to the server. You also need to set the local host `address` field to `0.0.0.0` in order to make it open for all the ports.

**Important:** Changes that need to be done in .env file is as shown below:

```
HOST = 5000 // or enter your own port
PASSWD = // Enter the password of your organizations gmail account.
DBPASS = // Enter your mongodb user password
```
PASSWD is required for password reset. A mail will be sent to user for password reset link. This mail will be sent by the Organization's email id, hence password is required.
